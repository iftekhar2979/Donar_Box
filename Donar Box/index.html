          Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be
          reduced by tax or administrative costs, preventing the full amount
          from reaching the people or causes they really want to help.
          Thankfully there are ways to make the most of every donation to
          charity.

        give to causes important to them, and could even bring about a
        family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special
        significance to you as a group.
